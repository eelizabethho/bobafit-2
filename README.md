# BobaFit 🧋

Nutrition tracking app that shows nutrition facts for foods using the CalorieNinjas API.

## Project Overview

BobaFit allows users to quickly search for any food and instantly view nutrition facts such as calories, protein, carbohydrates, fats, and fiber.
The app includes autocomplete search, enabling users to find items faster and explore healthier eating habits without needing to manually inspect food labels.

This project was built to learn the fundamentals of full-stack development, API integration, and cloud backend architecture using AWS services.

## How to Run

### Quick Start (All You Need!)

1. **Install Node.js 18+** if you don't have it: [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/)
